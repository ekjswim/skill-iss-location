My Mycroft Skill 001

This skill allows Mycroft to tell you where the International Space Station(ISS) in orbit
realtive to the Earth in latitude and longitude. It uses reverse geocoding to translate these
coordinates into the conntry or body of water it is over.

To get this done we need
  - Python 2.7
  - Python libraries: json, urllib2
  - That
  - The other thing
